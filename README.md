## Hacking

This project requires [conda(1)](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

Assuming it is in the path, run:

```shell
make init
```

The above command will create a ready to use python environment in `.env` dir.

Use `.env/bin/python3` to run executables and setup it as a python interpreter for your IDE.
